<h3>Publishing to YouTube via Screenr</h3>
<p>We use Screenr (<a href="http://www.screenr.com/" target="_blank">www.screenr.com</a>) to capture on-screen videos. It's a really simple system - here's a breakdown of the steps involved.</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>First, <strong>access Screenr</strong> by clicking the handy Screenr icon below your wordpress post (where you clicked this help icon), or navigate directly to <a href="http://www.screenr.com/" target="_blank">www.screenr.com</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Click on <strong>Launch Screen Record Now</strong> button (under the intro video).</p></li>
    <li><p>Screenr will automatically detect if you have Java installed or not. If not, Java installation is piece of cake (it may take a few minutes though). Go to Java.com and hit Free Java Download, and follow the instructions.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Screen Recorder should now be loaded, and you'll see a resizable box appear. At this point, you'll probably want to <strong>navigate to your original blog article</strong> and position the recorder box to your heart's desire. You may also want to alter the capture size - for YouTube, 720x540 is pretty decent if you don't plan on a full screen presentation.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Make sure your microphone is on</strong> (assuming you want sound), then hit the red record button! When you're done, just click the green "Done" button.</p></li>
    <li><p>You now have to <strong>navigate back to Screenr</strong>. If you're happy with the preview, hit Publish at the bottom. This will save the video. For Publishing, you will need to log in with either a new Screenr account, or use an existing Google account to log in.</p></li>
    <li><p>Your video will now be published on Screenr, but you're not done yet - hit the <strong>"Publish to YouTube"</strong> on the right, where you will be prompted for your username and password.<em><strong></p><p>NB:</strong> Sometimes Google will <strong>block suspicious activity</strong> - if you are sure your YouTube username & password are correct but Screenr cannot login, please login to YouTube. You may find a message appear: "Warning: Someone signed in to your account from a different location. Was it you?". Click on the "Was it you?" link and follow the instructions from there - you will of course have to say it was you, and allow the application access.</em></p></li>
    <li><p>Once your video is uploaded, <strong>navigate to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/my_videos" target="_blank">youtube.com/my_videos</a></strong> where you will probably want to edit the title of your new video by clicking the Edit button.</p></li>
    <li><p>Happy with the video? To find the YouTube embed code navigate to the video, then hit "Share", then "Embed". You should see some HTML code in the box - <strong>copy the contents of that box</strong> then <strong>paste it into the Screenr embed code box</strong> under your new blog post.</p></li>
    <li><p>To display the video into your post, <strong>write the shortcode "[video]"</strong> into your content whereever you please.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Don't forget to save the draft or publish your post!</strong></p></li>
    <li><p>...</p></li>
    <li><p>Profit!</p></li>
</ol>
